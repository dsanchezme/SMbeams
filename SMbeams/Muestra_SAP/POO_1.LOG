 THE STRUCTURE IS UNSTABLE OR ILL-CONDITIONED !!
 CHECK THE STRUCTURE CAREFULLY FOR:
 - INADEQUATE SUPPORT CONDITIONS, OR
 - ONE OR MORE INTERNAL MECHANISMS, OR
 - ZERO OR NEGATIVE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - EXTREMELY LARGE STIFFNESS PROPERTIES, OR
 - BUCKLING DUE TO P-DELTA OR GEOMETRIC NONLINEARITY, OR
 - A FREQUENCY SHIFT (IF ANY) ONTO A NATURAL FREQUENCY

 TO OBTAIN FURTHER INFORMATION:
 - USE THE STANDARD SOLVER, OR
 - RUN AN EIGEN ANALYSIS USING AUTO FREQUENCY SHIFTING (WITH
   ADDITIONAL MASS IF NEEDED) AND INVESTIGATE THE MODE SHAPES


 ---------------------------------
 BASIC STABILITY CHECK FOR LINEAR LOAD CASES:
    NUMBER OF NEGATIVE STIFFNESS EIGENVALUES SHOULD BE ZERO FOR STABILITY.
    (NOTE: FURTHER CHECKS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS DEEMED NECESSARY,
     SUCH AS REVIEWING EIGEN MODES FOR MECHANISMS AND RIGID-BODY MOTION)

    NUMBER OF NEGATIVE EIGENVALUES         =           0,  OK.
